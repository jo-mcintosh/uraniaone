I'm using resp= in place of ref=, like I'm doing in the episodes, but I'm not sure it's the same sort of situation or if I should just use ana= or some other attribute. Also, I'm not marking every pronoun. My larger question is: does it matter? My original idea a year ago was to make sure that who is speaking is named on each page of the transcription, but that was before I understood that this could be contained in the <said> element. Still, my goal is for any audience to be able to quickly identify who is speaking on a given page in only one step, whatever that step is. Is that work for the xml?

        <p>In this passion she went on, till she came to the foote of a great rocke, shee

            <lb/> dings making the ascent pleasing. Having attained the top, she saw under
            <lb/>some hollow trees the entrie into the rocke: she fearing nothing but the con-
            <lb/> tinuance of her ignorance, went in; where shee found a pretty roome, as if
            <lb/>that stonie place had yet in pitie, given leave for such perfections to come in-
            <lb/>to the heart as chiefest, and most beloved place, beause most loving. The

            <lb/>instead of hangings, convered and lined with Ivie, disdaining ought else should

LIB. 1.</fw><!-- Julia: wwp does not tag this, but I want these renditional features for the final design so that if anyone opens the Hathi digital edition, for example, the visual designs are similar. If this were a manuscript, I might feel differently. But this is a published work by a woman in 1621. I think that it is important to at least nod to the material artifact and preserve some of that in some way with in this edition. That's why I keep coming back to what might seem insignificant features. For many this might be the only exposure they ever have to the miracle that a woman published a book in 1621 that they could still put their eyes and hands on today. The 18-22 year olds that I teach are dumbfounded and resentful that they did not know about Wroth's work sooner or even heard her name mentioned. Learning about her production and life shifts their perspective. That's anecdotal, I know, but I've taught her for 10 years now, almost every semester, and the reaction is always the same.  -->

               I find it dumbfounding that students and scholars alike will ignore the inherent violence in these stories that mirror the reality: dominant groups maintain that dominance
               ultimately through an ever present threat of violence-be that physical abuse or control of resouces such as food and shelter. Manipulation and threat of violence are the impetus, 
               what Limena is responding to. Is she complying out of love for her father and Perissus, or she 
               quelling violences by sacrificing herself and submitting? If she had not married the country lord, and her father's castle had been overrun, what would have happened to her?  The King and Perissus 
               were already fighting back rebellion in other areas, so the outcome of the larger battle is still unknown, and they may not have been able to come to her and her family's aid. It sounds like she loves her father, 
               and she certainly loves Perissus, but that is not the impetus for the choices Limena must make. She tries to protect both her father and Perissus in addition to the reality of her inherent vulnerability in this system.-->

                association with characters, class, racializationn, and variuos plot themes. More immediately important
               to me for this fall phase of my work is that they are marked as characters in the text without whom
               the plots would have to change. Individuals like this particular messenger could be glossed over as unimportant
               despite their role in this plot. Like most things in this romance, destablizing and securing 
               aristocratic lineal identity is possible because of the labor of messengers and servants, ships captains and deckhands, cooks and gardeners; blacksmiths and stablehands
               ; this is why an Index of Characters is so important to me in this edition. In Roberts's Index of Characters, some of these agents of plot and narrative progress are noted, but are they all? If I'm tagging characters who are central to the plot, why would I not tag these characters without whom the action could not take place? 
               I'm not sure that a reference string addresses what I am trying to accomplish in the same way that persName does, but I could be totally wrong in that thinking.
               Maybe I'm relying on the element to do work it should not do and need to focus, instead, on including these characters rather than which element is used to include them? 
             Statement: This addition adds to Roberts's Index of Characters by including ____. 
               The insidiousness is that Wroth names the Servant as faithful to distinguish them from unfaithful servants, and I understand this as a proto imperial mindset. 
               Loyal v. unloyal and faithful v. unfaithful support the class structure. I think that it is going to be a worthwhile exercise to see how often and it what circumstances unnamed characters are described in terms of their faithfullness, 
               an aristocrat, or a noble, what form that faithfulness takes, and what purpose that faithfulness serves. I can't do that analysis now, but I can tag these instances in now. -->

The daughter is not an aristocrat simply by association, but she is not gaining more security and social mobility opportunities because of her association with Urania. Also, does the text ever mention her by name again? Is she now just "maid" or "seruant" even though for like sixteen years they thought they were sisters?

        Philargus: Perissus reports that Limena calls him Husband. The levels of narrative are complicated, because she calls him this where it is just marked <said> for what Limena is saying, but this is actually Perissus relaying to Urania what his Page relayed to him. Just before this, Perissus referes to Philargus as this wild man, her husband. How is wild man a different use? You could replace man and husband with each other and they work grammatically as well as tonally. What changes is that there is perhaps a wild man trope, like Nereana being mistaken for a wild woman in the forest? If this is what Wroth alludes to, then husband and wild man are very different things and cannot replace each other. Both are interesting. What sorts of men are called husband? What sorts other names?   All names are not created equal, and there are too many unique situations for me to be able to tag them all this time through. I don't think I even have enough time to think through each sitation and what it might mean in order to tag names for characters as types. I want to focus on maids, servants, messengers, and pages whose roles are necessary for the plots to progress. I'll keep tagging daugher, husband, wife, king, etc when it references someone in the standOff list. If they are a lower social class. So here are the types of name tagging I'm saying I'm going to do: 
            1. persName linked to standOff list that includes characters without proper names whose role moves the plot forward
            2. other names and pronouns when they reference someone in the standOff list
            3. other names and pronouns that I will add to the standOff list when they do not have a proper name such as daughter, wife, parents, etc, because I'm seeing a pattern -->
